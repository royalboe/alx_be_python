# Python Introduction Project

This project serves as a gentle introduction to the world of Python programming. You will explore what Python is, understand its applications, and gain hands-on experience setting up your development environment.

Additionally, you'll dive into the basics of Python syntax, learn about its focus on readability, and understand the importance of proper indentation. By the end, youâ€™ll have built a strong foundation for writing simple yet powerful Python programs.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Define what Python is and understand its key characteristics as a high-level programming language.
- Identify various application areas where Python is commonly used.
- Install Python on your system and set up a development environment to start writing code.
- Explain the importance of indentation in Python and how it contributes to code readability.
- Write basic Python code following proper syntax guidelines.

## âœ… Tasks Overview

### 0. Basic Arithmetic Exercise

**File Name:** `basic_operations.py`  
**Link:** [basic_operations.py](basic_operations.py)

**Objective:** Practice basic arithmetic operations in Python using predefined numbers.

- Assign `number1 = 10` and `number2 = 5`.
- Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- Print results in a clear, human-readable format.

**Expected Output:**

`
Addition of 10 and 5 is 15
Subtraction of 10 and 5 is 5
Multiplication of 10 and 5 is 50
`

### 1. Simple Interest Calculator

**File Name:** `simple_interest.py`  
**Link:** [simple_interest.py](simple_interest.py)

**Objective:** Apply arithmetic operations to calculate simple interest.

- Define `principal = 1000`, `rate = 0.05`, and `time = 3`.
- Use the formula `interest = principal * rate * time`.
- Print the result clearly.

**Expected Output:**

`
The simple interest is: 150.0
`

### 2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle

**File Name:** `rectangle_area.py`  
**Link:** [rectangle_area.py](rectangle_area.py)

**Objective:** Use basic arithmetic to calculate the area of a rectangle.

- Define `length = 10` and `width = 5`.
- Calculate `area = length * width`.
- Print the area clearly.

**Expected Output:**
`The area of the rectangle is: 50`

### 3. Convert Hours to Seconds

**File Name:** `hours_to_seconds.py`  
**Link:** [hours_to_seconds.py](hours_to_seconds.py)

**Objective:** Convert a given number of hours into seconds.

- Define `hours = 2`.
- Calculate `seconds = hours * 3600`.
- Print the result clearly.

**Expected Output:**
`2 hour(s) is 7200 seconds.`

### 4. User Input Age Calculator

**File Name:** `future_age_calculator.py`  
**Link:** [future_age_calculator.py](future_age_calculator.py)

**Objective:** Practice receiving user input and performing an arithmetic calculation.

- Prompt the user: "How old are you? ".
- Assume current year is 2023; calculate age in 2050 (current age + 27).
- Print the result in a user-friendly format.

**Example Interaction:**

`
How old are you? 30
In 2050, you will be 57 years old.
`

### 5. Personal Finance Calculator

**File Name:** `finance_calculator.py`  
**Link:** [finance_calculator.py](finance_calculator.py)

**Objective:** Use user input, variables, and arithmetic to calculate savings and project future value.

- Prompt for monthly income and expenses.
- Calculate `monthly_savings = income - expenses`.
- Project annual savings with 5% interest: `annual_savings = monthly_savings * 12 + (monthly_savings * 12 * 0.05)`.
- Print both results clearly.

**Example Interaction:**
`
Enter your monthly income: 5000
Enter your total monthly expenses: 4000
Your monthly savings are $1000.
Projected savings after one year, with interest, is: $12600.0
`
