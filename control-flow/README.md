# Python Control Flow & Loops Project

This project dives into the world of control flow and loops â€” essential concepts for introducing logic and automation into your Python programs. You will learn how to make decisions using conditional statements and automate repetitive tasks using loops. By mastering these, you'll be able to write more dynamic, efficient, and readable code.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the concept of control flow and its role in programming.
- Utilize conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`) to control execution flow based on specific conditions.
- Write practical examples demonstrating the use of conditional statements for decision-making.
- Understand and implement `match case` statements introduced in Python 3.10 as an alternative to multiple `if/elif` blocks (optional if using Python versions below 3.10).
- Explain and apply best practices for using `match case` statements to enhance code readability and efficiency.
- Understand the purpose and types of loops available in Python.
- Use `for` loops to iterate over sequences (lists, tuples, strings, etc.).
- Write examples demonstrating `for` loops to iterate over data structures.
- Understand `while` loops and how they differ from `for` loops.
- Implement `while` loops to execute code repeatedly while a condition is true.
- Understand and apply nested loops (loops within loops) to handle multidimensional data or create patterns.

## âœ… Tasks Overview

### 0. Weather Recommendation Program

**File Name:** `weather_advice.py`  
**Link:** [weather_advice.py](weather_advice.py)

**Objective:** Use conditional statements to guide program execution based on user-provided weather conditions.

- Prompts for weather: `sunny`, `rainy`, or `cold`.
- Provides appropriate clothing recommendations.
- Handles unexpected inputs with an informative message.

### 1. Simple Calculator with Match Case

**File Name:** `match_case_calculator.py`  
**Link:** [match_case_calculator.py](match_case_calculator.py)

**Objective:** Use `match case` statements to handle different arithmetic operations.

- Prompts for two numbers (`num1`, `num2`) and an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- Executes the chosen operation using `match case`.
- Handles division by zero gracefully.

---

### 2. Multiplication Table Generator

**File Name:** `multiplication_table.py`  
**Link:** [multiplication_table.py](multiplication_table.py)

**Objective:** Use a `for` loop to generate a multiplication table.

- Prompts the user for a number.
- Prints the multiplication table from 1 to 10.

---

### 3. Drawing Patterns with Nested Loops

**File Name:** `pattern_drawing.py`  
**Link:** [pattern_drawing.py](pattern_drawing.py)

**Objective:** Use `while` loops and nested `for` loops to draw a text-based pattern.

- Prompts for a positive integer to determine the pattern size.
- Prints a square pattern of asterisks (`*`) with sides equal to the input size.

---

### 4. Personal Daily Reminder

**File Name:** `daily_reminder.py`  
**Link:** [daily_reminder.py](daily_reminder.py)

**Objective:** Use conditional statements, `match case`, and loops to create a personalized task reminder.

- Prompts for a task description, priority (high/medium/low), and whether it is time-bound.
- Provides a custom reminder message based on the inputs.
